# Dice Roll Mobile Application

This project was built as a learning project for Flutter. 
It uses basic Flutter concepts and syntax to create a UI with a roll dice button and an image of the dice.

It introduces topics such as:
- Widgets (MaterialApp, Scaffold, Decorations, Containers, Text, Images, Buttons, etc)
- Styling (backgroundColor, fontSize, padding, textStyle, etc)
- States (Stateless vs Stateful)


## Getting Started

To build the application, you need the following:
- Flutter (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Emulator: Android Studio or Xcode
- IDE

Once you have successfully run 'flutter doctor' and checked all dependencies, clone the repository onto your local machine. 
Double-check the project structure, specifically the path to the assets folder for the dice_roller.dart file.
